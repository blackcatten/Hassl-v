      Just above Hasslöv, you can pick both berries and mushrooms of various species, including blueberries,
      raspberries, blackberries and rare, but also cloudberries if you're lucky. Scenic area with its nature reserves 
      and nice views over, among other things, the sea where you can see Denmark. There is also a stream with a beautiful 
      waterfall that you can see if you like that kind of thing. An adventure for the whole family.

      The "Stensån" runs in Hasslöv and you can fish in scenic valleys with a rich bird and animal life. 
      Stensån is classified as national interest because of its salmon and trout stocks. 
      Downstream Vindrarp's bridge winds its way through the agricultural landscape to Hasslöv's bridge. 
      From here it flows calmly in a channel-like course, a result of previous clearings and straightening, 
      where before that it meandered past Skottorps castle and under the old bridge at the E6. 
      Fish species that occur are brown trout, sea trout, salmon, perch, pike, whiting, eel, greenling and sea lionfish. 
      In 1998, approximately 140 salmon were caught. Largest salmon weighed about 12 kg. 
      Largest sea trout approx. 8 kg. A pleasure for the whole family
