      In Hasslöv, you can visit "Lugnarohögen" is a burial mound from the Younger Bronze Age located at Lugnaro, 
      a croft in Hasslöv, Halland. The mound was excavated in 1926–27, and under a cairn in the middle of the mound, 
      an 8-meter-long stone setting in the shape of a ship was found. 
      This was the first ship burial in a Bronze Age mound found in Sweden. 
      You can find this and much more in this fantastic place in Hasslöv

      The "Stensån" runs in Hasslöv and you can fish in scenic valleys with a rich bird and animal life. 
      Stensån is classified as national interest because of its salmon and trout stocks. 
      Downstream Vindrarp's bridge winds its way through the agricultural landscape to Hasslöv's bridge. 
      From here it flows calmly in a channel-like course, a result of previous clearings and straightening, 
      where before that it meandered past Skottorps castle and under the old bridge at the E6. 
      Fish species that occur are brown trout, sea trout, salmon, perch, pike, whiting, eel, greenling and sea lionfish. 
      In 1998, approximately 140 salmon were caught. Largest salmon weighed about 12 kg. 
      Largest sea trout approx. 8 kg. A pleasure for the whole family
