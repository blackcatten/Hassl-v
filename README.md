## Features:

### Existing Features:

1. Navigation bar.

- Orange backgroundcolor has been chosen because Osbeck's beech forests are very beautiful in autumn and the autumn color describes the old forest with beech trees that are up to 200 years old. The handwritten style of the text has been chosen because of the petroglyphs and the old forest together. The salmon fishing that has been fished since time immemorial in the free river, i.e. no hydroelectric power plant in the river "stensån". The icons of the tree and the fish are inserted to show that the website is about both fishing and forest. The navigation bar contains home, gallery and contact. By clicking on each of them, users can go to different pages. It has been used :hover to highlight brown color.
