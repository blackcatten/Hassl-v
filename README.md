1. Navigation bar.

- Orange backgroundcolor has been chosen because Osbeck's beech forests are very beautiful in autumn and the autumn color describes the old forest with beech trees that are up to 200 years old. The handwritten style of the text has been chosen because of the petroglyphs and the old forest together. The salmon fishing that has been fished since time immemorial in the free river, i.e. no hydroelectric power plant in the river "stensån".
